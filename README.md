It is an tecnology that rather than narrowing down nfts as trading objects makes them safer,I.e it lets people use their pre existing nfts to stake it on the paltform so that they can play a simple and fun maze game with other players and as taking crypto as stakes for games makes the project an actual gambling platform which many of us dont want secondly as the nfts the preexisting ones are being used to stake we can change a lot of things as people wont have to trust people with the crypto transfer but nft transfer which makes people feel a lot secure to play the games and as i am using polygon chain to do the entire process the process is fast and efficient and thirdly we are using nft floor price feeds to get the floor price related to nft so that when people play the games its far more reliable than ever changing crypto market and also this will increase revenue on  the chain as more and more people will buy nfts from the chain to trade them and 5th its going to bring a big change as all the nft gaming platforms give their own nfts to trade this project is not going to give the users an nft that has no market besides the game the users after winning can easily list their nfts on the chain and sell it in a far more reliable legal and safer way,as its going to use subgraphs its going tto use subgraphs in a whole new way as a way of floor price based matchmaking so that people only play with other players in the same floor price margin to avoid any violation. and also its going to give you an simple game that i came up with myself to let you play in real time with other players and also build tension by letting players see the progress of their opponents but not theirs,so overall its an fun and unique and new way to make nfts something that they were supposed to be and also use them in a new way.It is an tecnology that rather than narrowing down nfts as trading objects makes them safer,I.e it lets people use their pre existing nfts to stake it on the paltform so that they can play a simple and fun maze game with other players and as taking crypto as stakes for games makes the project an actual gambling platform which many of us dont want secondly as the nfts the preexisting ones are being used to stake we can change a lot of things as people wont have to trust people with the crypto transfer but nft transfer which makes people feel a lot secure to play the games and as i am using polygon chain to do the entire process the process is fast and efficient and thirdly we are using nft floor price feeds to get the floor price related to nft so that when people play the games its far more reliable than ever changing crypto market and also this will increase revenue on  the chain as more and more people will buy nfts from the chain to trade them and 5th its going to bring a big change as all the nft gaming platforms give their own nfts to trade this project is not going to give the users an nft that has no market besides the game the users after winning can easily list their nfts on the chain and sell it in a far more reliable legal and safer way,as its going to use subgraphs its going tto use subgraphs in a whole new way as a way of floor price based matchmaking so that people only play with other players in the same floor price margin to avoid any violation. and also its going to give you an simple game that i came up with myself to let you play in real time with other players and also build tension by letting players see the progress of their opponents but not theirs,so overall its an fun and unique and new way to make nfts something that they were supposed to be and also use them in a new way.
